This feature creates a form for the selected Table object; currently, you can choose between Simple List and SimpleListDetails patterns. Path: [Table Element] > HMT > Generate Form For Table.

## Prerequisites

The selected table object must have at least one field in the Overview group (though this does not affect form creation).

## Demonstration

1. Select a Table; the Overview must contain at least one field.
2. Fill in parameters and modify as needed.
3. Click Create; the form and MenuItem will be created successfully.
